### Changes in this repo 


The `api_utils` module provides utility functions for working with different APIs. It includes three files: `image_api.py`, `pexels_api.py`, and  `youtube_api.py` `eleven_api.py`. Each file contains functions related to a specific API.

#### `search_videos_YouTube(query_string)`

The search_videos_YouTube function takes a query string as input and searches for a video on YouTube based on that query. It returns the URL of the first search result if found, or None if no video is found.

Integration of `shortGPT.api_utils.youtube_api`, which serves as an additional source for gathering footage based on the queried keyword. This is particularly useful when dealing with niche / comedy / meme topics where stock footage is not available. If nothing matches we backtrack to the pexels API. 


### Demo
