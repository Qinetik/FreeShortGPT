EVERYTHING is handled offline except the youtube API  

My code now includes YouTube integration ` search_res = youtube.search().list(**search_params).execute()`, which serves as an additional source for gathering footage. This is particularly useful when dealing with niche / comedy / meme topics where stock footage is not available.

My llama2 agent surpasses gpt-3.5 in terms of raw quality without relying on prompted templates. Someone banned me from the dc for no reason, so I see no need to make it public. Just a follow up post.
